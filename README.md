# Data Visualization using Dimple.js

### Summary
In this project, I created three plots using Dimple.js library. The data set is obtained as a part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Course on Data Visualization. The data set contains demographics of the infamous sinking of Titanic ship. In this project, I am trying to analyze the factors that could affect the survival rate from the ship. The first plot is a bar plot of travelling alone or not alone on Titanic versus the survival rate. Second plot is a line plot with scatter plot of age group versus the survival rate. Third and final plot is class of travel versus survival rate.  

### Design
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

I have drawn the following plots to visualize the survival rate.  
1. Rate of Survival versus travelling alone/not alone.  
2. Rate of Survival versus age.  
3. Rate of Survival versus class of travel and gender.
