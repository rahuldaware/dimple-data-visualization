   <div align="center">
		<p> This article is about RMS Titanic. A cruise which started its journey from London to New York. On April 15th, 1912, whci happened to be its debut voyage, the ship sank after colliding with an iceberg which had tremendous casualties. Out of 2204 passenger on board, 1502 of them were killed. In this article, I am trying to present some visualizations which could point to the factors which helped to survival.

		<div id="visualization1"></div>
		<p> Here, we can see that, infants and children had higher survival rate. Naturally, they were given preference to life boats after the crash.

		<div id="visualization2"></div>
		<p> Here, it is visible that, people who travelled with family had more chance of being saved than the ones travelling alone.

	<div  align="center">
		<div id="visualization3"></div>
		<p> We can see that Class 1 had higher survival rate here for both genders. The survival rate decreased with lower classes. Also, males were given less preference to life boats than females.

        <p>
	To conclude, we can see class based treatment from this plots. Lower class of travel were given less preference than the higher classes. Childrens were given more preference than adults. Finally, those travelling with family had better chance to survive.
